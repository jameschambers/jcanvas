h1. jCanvas

jCanvas is a jQuery plugin to make dealing with the new &lt;canvas\&gt; tag as easy and painless as possible with a hint of jQuery like syntax.

h3. Text support

Currently only Firefox supports text in a canvas element, with a different API for FF3.1+ and previous versions. jCanvas deals with this for you, with firefox rendering the text fine and all other browsers having a div positioned absolute above the canvas in the correct position.
